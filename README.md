## 1. Introduction

At **Evolve**, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the **Evolve** mobile application.

**Evolve** is designed as an **offline-first fitness and wellness app**. At this time, the app **does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data on external servers**. All data entered into the app remains **locally on your device**.

By using **Evolve**, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 3. Data Collection, Use, and Sharing

**Evolve does not collect or share personal data.**

- No user data is sent to the developer or any external server  
- No analytics, advertising, or tracking tools are used  
- No cloud sync is enabled by default  

All information you enter—such as fitness data, nutrition logs, sleep records, or wellness details—is stored **only on your device** using local storage.

The developer has **no access** to your data.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

**Evolve** does **not** integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, advertising networks, or data brokers that collect user data.

Please note that your device’s operating system (Android or iOS) and other apps installed on your device may have their own privacy policies. **Evolve** is not responsible for data handled by those systems.

---

## 5. Permissions

**Evolve** may request limited permissions strictly required for core functionality, such as:

- Physical activity or step tracking (if enabled by the user)
- Local storage access for saving app data

These permissions are:
- Used only within the app  
- Never used to collect or transmit data externally  
- Optional where possible  

**Evolve does not access** contacts, camera, microphone, location, or network data for tracking purposes.

---

## 6. Security and Data Protection

Since **Evolve** does not collect or transmit data, all security depends on your device’s protections.

We strongly recommend that users:
- Use device-level security such as PINs, passwords, or biometric locks  
- Keep their operating system updated  
- Avoid using the app on compromised or rooted devices  

The developer is not responsible for unauthorized access resulting from inadequate device security.

---

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion

Because all data is stored locally:

- You have full control over your information  
- You can delete your data at any time by clearing app storage or uninstalling the app  

No data is retained by the developer.

---

## 8. Legal Compliance

**Evolve** is designed to comply with applicable data protection laws, including:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  
- Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)  

As no personal data is collected or processed, most regulatory obligations do not apply beyond transparency and user control.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

**Evolve** is provided on an “as is” basis.

The developer is not liable for:
- Data loss due to device failure  
- Unauthorized access caused by user negligence  
- Any damages resulting from misuse of the app  

Users are responsible for safeguarding their own devices and data.

- No personal or sensitive data is collected from any user, including children  
- Children under 13 may use the app under parental supervision  
- The app complies with **COPPA** and **Google Play Families Policy**  

If you believe a child has used the app in a way that violates these principles, please contact the developer.

## 11. Updates to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect:

- New features (such as optional cloud sync)  
- Legal or regulatory changes  
- Operational updates  

Any significant changes will be reflected in the app store listing or within the app. Continued use of **Evolve** after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
